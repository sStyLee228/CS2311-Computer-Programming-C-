# CS3334-Data-Structures

This repository contains my solutions for Assignment problems given throughout the course. 
This may be considered as a reference to how I approach problem solving, my code styling, and knowledge of core data structures. 
All the problems were solved in C++ as was required by the course.
Please refer to both problem files and the corresponding solution; 
problem and the solution are matched by both problem name and number, e.g. 78 Largest Subsequence is matched with 78.pdf (problem text).
